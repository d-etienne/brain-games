# Brain Games

## Project Goal

Assisting students in developing and strengthing their cognitive or linguistic abilities through mini "brain" games that focus on cognitive and/or linguistic skills.

These games are split into categories that focus on specific skills, such as:

* memory - enhances a persons ability to remember as well increasing their ability focus (i.e matching of cards)
* languages - enhances / examines  your fluency in English vocabulary (i.e. word permutation game)
* reaction time / perception - enhances the users visual to muscle reflexes and trains the users sensory sharpness (i.e spot the difference between two present images)
* numeracy - trains the users algebraic skills (i.e mathematical operator game)
* reasoning - enhances the users ability to notice patterns / relationships between objects (i.e tangrams)



In order to build production, in the top level directory, run:

`make prod`


## Requirements

The requirements for a design project include:

1. Everything under source code control.
1. Documentation integrated with code.
1. Project build automated.
1. Automated testing in place.
1. Automated code checking in place.
1. Test code coverage measured.
1. Automated deployment to production.

## Design

The following is a standard toolkit for this course. You *may* use other tools,
but our ability to help you master them will not be as high as with the
standard tools.

1. Use `git`
1. Use `pydoc`
1. Use `make`
1. Use `unittest`
1. Use `flake8`
1. Use `coverage`
1. Use `Travis`
